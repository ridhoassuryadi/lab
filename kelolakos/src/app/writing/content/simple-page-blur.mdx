If you carefully look at the bottom and top of my website, you'll observe that it's kinda blurred/faded at the ends. It's a very small detail, but it's these small details that come together to deliver a robust experience.

This is a neat and subtle detail that I first saw this on [Paco Coursey](https://paco.me/)'s site and wanted to add it onto mines.

## Bottom Blur

We'll just use a simple `div` and add some styling to it:

```html
<div class="blur" aria-hidden="true" />
```

```css
.blur {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: -10px;
  z-index: 1;
  height: 40px;
  width: 100vw;
  opacity: 0.95;
  filter: blur(8px);
  backdrop-filter: blur(16px);
}
```

## Top Blur

To blur the top, just switch the `bottom` value on the CSS to `top` and keep the same value:

```css
.blur {
  top: -10px;
}
```

That's all. If you're using Tailwind CSS like me, just inspect element and copy the last two elements inside of the `body` tag.
